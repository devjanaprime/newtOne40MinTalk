Intro & overview
================
* classic 3d-platformer
* (truly) non-violent
* enjoyable and approachable by all ages
* levels should be succinct (about 3-5 min for experienced players)
* highly replayable (parrots, notes, achievements, narrative unlocks, etc)
* non-linear
* multiple platforms (console launch first XBOne, hopefully)
* increase happiness and well-being... possible? We'd like to try and find out
